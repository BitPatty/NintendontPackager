    -merged SD and USB kernel into a single one
    -fixed a very small bug in both DI and SD code, probably a very few people will have a benefit from that
    -removed loader.elf and boot.dol since everything only takes the loader.dol anyways, lets not waste any space
    -general code cleanup
```
