    -corrected a small mistake on the disc read speed emulation code, it was too fast because of a missing number, this might help out certain game desync issues
    -added slow read speed settings for king kong to improve its chances of all triggers working, please note that it still has a possibility of not triggering events at times
    -made it possible to start triforce games from disc/WODE
    -added code to clear out the emulated audio ram for general safety
