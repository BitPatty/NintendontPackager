    -Added database support for those unsightly game names.  Copy the included titles.txt to your Nintendont directory
    -The loader now updates the meta.xml file prior to checking for AHB access, so you don't have to fix the meta.xml file manually.
    
    Note: To save space, the database doesn't care about region.
```
