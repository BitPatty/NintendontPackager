    -Fixed previous status messages disappearing if there is an error
    -Fixed the menu info appearing one frame after the games/options
    -251 blocks is now listed as recommended in the "Memcard Blocks" option
    -Set the groundwork for a timeout if the drive doesn't respond.  This doesn't work yet, and I can't finish it until I receive a drive that doesn't work (it's coming)
    -Moved the options up 13 pixels for people who had the bottom cut off
    -A few minor cleanups.
```
