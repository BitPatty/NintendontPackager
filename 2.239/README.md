    -Reworked part of how the update system works
    -HID files are now saved to the drive with games, not the drive that Nintendont was launched from.
    -You are now given a choice to redownload the latest version in case someone forgets to update NintendontVersion.h
    -Changed the update menu to be scrollable.
    -Menus use an actual arrow now instead of a greater/lesser than symbol.
    -Got rid of the loader.h/loader.c files since they haven't been necessary for I don't know how long
    -A little minor cleanup.
```
