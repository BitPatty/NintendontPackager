    -added alot of exceptions to fix Killer7, Cubivore, Frogger's Adventures, Two Towers, Chibi-Robo, Resident Evil 4, Hudson Selection Vol 2 and Kururin Squash
    -if you dont give a cache.txt, nintendont will automatically cache files, thats not as efficient but should help improve loading times if you get to some area a second time for example
