    -fixed a drastic bug in triforce code which randomly broke all sorts of commands, this should help out various problems such as JVSIO errors and not working controls
    -enabled CARD support in both GP1 and GP2 because they now seem to work on a usable level, to save into them you just need to say "no" on continue after racing, just wait a few seconds after that until you exit nintendont
