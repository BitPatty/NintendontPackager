    -changed out some buffers in jvsio and changed some flushing code in order to help out triforce random crashes, missing controls and problems
    -changed the default triforce ingame coin count to 9 so just in case it doesnt automatically refresh the coins you dont run out directly and may get lucky on the next coin update to get new coins
    -commented out some possibly problematic debug code which might crash games on bootup
    -added ARStartDMA exceptions for both Multi-Game Demo Disc 18 and Street Racing Syndicate
```
