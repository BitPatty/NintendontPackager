    -made the ARStartDMA crash solution more complex for need for speed hot pursuit 2 to hopefully get it more stable
    -fixed a bug in ARStartDMA which used the wrong memory address base, that should fix some games like tony hawk pro skater
    -increased HID controller reading, it now reads about 60 times a second
    -added chronicles of narnia to the ARQPostRequest exception list
```
