    -Gave Nintendont a nice polished interface.  It now has a background and a truetype font (no more jaggies)
    -You can now see more of the game title.
    -Fixed a warning if DEBUG_PATCH is disabled.
    
    Thanks to ccfman2004, VinsCool, and Shiranui-san for the valuable input they've provided on this release.
