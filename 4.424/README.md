    -added a new option called "TRI Arcade Mode", enabling this will remove all timer patches and the free play patch from triforce games giving it a more original feel, to insert coins in this mode just move the c-stick into any direction
    -fixed a bug which made nintendont crash on startup with no FAT device found, now it will properly exit
```
