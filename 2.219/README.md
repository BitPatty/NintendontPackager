    -make sure that for extremly slow hdds the bluetooth controller stays updated when reading a random sector every 10 seconds
    -changed up the widescreen patches C_MTXPerspective and C_MTXLightPerspective, should fix weird patch bugs in games like pokemon xd and colosseum
    -added a few selected game specific widescreen patches, credits for those go to Ralf from gc-forever for making the original ocarina codes
