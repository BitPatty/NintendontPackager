    -fixed a small bug with the mario karts, after entering the test menu the wheel init would not work anymore when leaving it
    -only allow the service button getting pressed when you are in the test menu, it just freezes up the game for a second otherwise
    -updated internal triforce game versions, now the mario karts have the build date as version and the unknown f-zero ax revision is now set to revision d
