# Nintendont Packager

This repository contains prepackaged [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont) revisions since version 1.0. New updates are added automatically - whenever there's one available - via a daily GitHub workflow.

Each version directory contains the following content:

- A zip file (`Nintendont.zip`) containing the files required to launch the application with Homebrew (`boot.dol`, `icon.png` and `meta.xml`)
- A readme with the changes / git commits that have been added since the previous version
