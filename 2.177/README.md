    -added a small patch security check to make sure we actually patch a game loader and not some random data, should fix games like resident evil
    -added a few more hacks from quadforce for f-zero ax to make it bootable (thanks crediar)
    -added pad read function patches for f-zero ax to make it controllable
```
