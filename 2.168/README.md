    -added a bit of code to actually allow usage of a real memory card on wii when memory card emulation is turned off
    -added a small compiler option in global.h, PATCHSI, if you comment out this option and recompile nintendont it will use the original gamecube pad ports instead of emulating them, allowing accessories like gba and bongos but will remove things like hid, bluetooth and return to loader
```
